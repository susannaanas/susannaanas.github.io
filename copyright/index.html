Copyright 101

Modern copyright laws have two distinct traditions. In the utilitarian view, copyright incentivizes the progress of science and innovation of literary and artistic production in the society whereas Author’s right is considered to protect the rights of the creator to benefit from their creation.

The utilitarian view is the model for copyright in common law jurisdictions. For example, the US Copyright Act of 1790 is based on that.

Author's right is the basis of legislation in the civil law jurisdictions of mainland Europe and much of the world, and in the development of international copyright agreements that try to harmonize copyright across jurisdictions. For example, The Berne Convention defines basic concepts, sets the minimum types and protection times.

The work

Copyright protects literary and artistic works as well as their translations, adaptations, arrangements and alterations, and collections of them. Types of protected works vary across jurisdictions. In Finland, a literary or artistic work may be fictional or explanatory, written or oral performance, composition or stage work, cinematographic work, photographic work or other work of fine art, architecture, handicraft or industrial art.

Literary works include maps and other explanatory drawings, graphic or plastical works and computer programs. 

Any time an intellectual work is created, it is automatically protected by copyright from the moment it starts to take shape.

What can be copyrighted?

The work must be unique and original to be protected by copyright.

Copyright does not protect an idea, a plot, a fact, or texts of laws, decrees or regulatory decisions. (Works like illustrations within them are handled individually.)

Related rights (neighbouring rights)

Related rights protect the rights of others involved in the creation of an artistic work, such as performers, recorders or producers. A simple photograph or a database can be protected by related rights.

A photograph may also be considered an artistic work. Each case is evaluated individually.

Intellectual property protection beyond copyright

There are other types of intellectual property protection that have different principles of protection.

A patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention for a limited period. The procedure to obtain a patent varies by jurisdiction.

A trademark is a protected sign that distinguishes the goods and services of a company from similar goods and services of other companies.

In the EU, industrial design rights are provided with a variety of national laws and as part of Community design.

Traditional knowledge and Traditional cultural expression are knowledge, know-how, skills and practices that are fostered and passed on from generation to generation within a community. 

While innovations based on traditional knowledge may benefit from intellectual property protection, knowledge that is often oral and has ancient roots, is not protected by conventional intellectual property systems. Therefore publishing culturally sensitive materials of underrepresented communities must be carefully considered.  

Copyright protects the creator’s moral and economic rights

Moral rights

The moral rights protect for example the creator’s right to be recognized as the author, or the right to protect the work from unwanted distortion or changes. In Finland, moral rights cannot be waived.

Economic rights

The economic rights grant the creator the exclusive right to produce copies and communicate the work to the public in the original or altered form. 

The distinction between moral and economic rights and their definition varies between legislations, but the Berne convention sets a baseline for the minimum protection.

The creator

In EU’s jurisdiction, the creator is always a natural person or a group.

Work for hire

In the US and some other jurisdictions corporate authorship or work-for-hire allows the employer to become the rightsholder of work committed by the employee. In Finland, the employee is considered the author, but they can transfer the economic rights to the employer contractually. In the case of a computer program or a database, the authorship resides automatically with the employer.

Ownership vs copyright

Copyright remains with the creator or rightsholder also after the sale of the work. The owner of the work can loan or sell the work, but is not allowed to create postcards or upload images of the work online, unless the creator and buyer agree on it in a contract.

Exceptions and limitations

The rights of the public to reuse copyrighted materials without permission have been secured by a wide array of exceptions and limitations to copyright. These exceptions and limitations vary greatly between jurisdictions, although there are attempts to harmonize them internationally. They are an important way to secure universal access to research and education and full participation in culture.

Fair use is an important exception in common law countries. It aims to secure public access to copyrighted materials in certain special	cases, if such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.

Public domain

Copyright eventually expires. In the EU, copyright is in effect for 70 years after the death of the last surviving creator. In Finland, the related rights protection of a simple photograph lasts for 50 years after the picture was taken. Databases are protected for 15 years.

The work enters public domain when copyright protection ends. It is free to be copied, altered and sold. In some jurisdictions moral rights expire, while in others they never do. However, it is good practice to always credit the creator.

There are also other ways a work can enter public domain. The creator can waive copyright contractually, or the work was never protected by copyright, like in the case of US governmental works. This state can also be called the Commons, public property.
